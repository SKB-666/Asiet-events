Sample prototype under development

To view the most basic demo,
1. Download build.rar file and extract
2. Install serve globally: npm install -g serve
3. From folder where build is located: serve -s build
4. Open url to view demo

It is the most basic frontend demo, it is not complete at the moment and has more work to be done and stuff to be included.
